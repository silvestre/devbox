This doc contains answers to frequently asked questions about Jetify Cloud that are not covered elsewhere in our documentation. If you have a question that isn't covered here, feel free to ask us on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/jetify)

## Do I have to pay to use Jetify Cloud?

Jetify accounts are free for individual developers, and includes access to Jetify Secrets. You can purchase deployment pipelines or other resources as needed by adding a credit card to your account.

Using Jetify with a team requires a paid Jetify Starter or Enterprise account. For details on other plans and limits, see our [**pricing**](https://www.jetify.com/cloud/pricing) page.

## How can I share my Jetify Cloud project with other developers?

To share secrets and access to deployments with other team members, you will need to create a new Jetify Starter Team and then invite developers to join your team. See the [cloud dashboard docs](./dashboard/creating_your_team.md) for more details. 

## What are the resource limits for my Jetify Deployments?

Jetify Deployments have the following resources by default:

1. **CPU**: 1 Shared CPUI
2. **Memory**: 512 MB

Deployments may also scale down to zero after several seconds of not receiving a request. More configurations and limits are currently available for Enterprise Plans. [Contact Us](https://calendly.com/d/3rd-bhp-qym/meet-with-the-jetify-team) for more details. 

## Do you offer self-hosted or private instances of Jetify Cloud?

We offer private instances and other features as part of our Enterprise Plan. [Contact us](https://calendly.com/d/3rd-bhp-qym/meet-with-the-jetify-team) so we can build a solution that meets your needs.
